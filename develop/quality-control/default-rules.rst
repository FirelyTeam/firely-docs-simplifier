Default Rules
-------------

Simplifier provides two default rule series: the minimal and the
recommended.

Minimal series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimal series a very small set of rules that we know everyone
aggrees on. In this minimal series included the bulk validation rule.
And that in itself is one of the most extensive form of validation you
can think of. So in that respect the mimal series is not small. It is
however what the FHIR standard describes that resources should adhere
to.

Recommended series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended series is a more opiniated set of rules that we defined,
of what we believe a FHIR project should conform too. But we also
acknowledge that these are more opiniated, and so we separated them.
Here you can think of rules like that every resource should have an id.
