Include
-------

If you run a ruleset file (a ``*.rules.yaml``), by default, no other
rules will be run. This is done to give you maximum control, and allow
you to run individual rule sets,

There is a ‘Run all Qualiy Control checks’ command in Simplifier.

But, there are situations where you would like to run an aditional set
of rules, that you have defined elsewhere (in another file). Imagine you
have a ruleset to ‘check broken links’, but want to run all the default
rules as a first step. You can achieve this by using the ‘include’
action.

This way you can also create a batch file, in which you include all your
other rule set files. In most cases this is unneeded complexity, because
your project is probably only in a good state if all the rules have
validated. So only use this if the default setup does not work for you.

Include action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You include the default rule set or any other ruleset in a , you can
speficy this in a single directive.

.. code-block:: yaml

   - include: <name>

For example, this will include the default ruleset:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - include: default

And this will include the custom ruleset file ``myrules.rules.yaml``

.. code-block:: yaml

   - include: myrules

Alternatively these will do the same:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - include: myrules.rules.yaml

   - include: some-directory/myrules.rules.yaml

It is not an issue to have multiple references to the same file, because
rules will be indexed by their name.
