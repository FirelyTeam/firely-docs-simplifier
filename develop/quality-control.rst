Quality Control: Validating FHIR Projects
=========================================

This specification describes how to write (and read) rules for the
Simplifier Quality Control Engine.

**Introduction**

*Simplifier.net* and *Firely Terminal* come with a Quality Control
Engine, to help you improve the quality of your FHIR projects. The QC
engine performs a series of rule checks. By default there are two a
series (minimal and recommended) of default rules, that you can run on
your project. But you can also define your own rules.

In order to follow one of the core principles of Simplifier: *eating
your own dogfood*: You can use the same language (YAML)that we used for
the default, to define your own rules. This way we share the experience
and have to deal with the same challenges that you would face as a user.
The same reason why we write all our documentation in the Simplifier
Implementation Guide editor.

**Project rule files**

You can add ``*.rules.yaml`` files to your project. In order for
Simplifier to pick them up, they should however be placed in the root.
All rules files in the root, will be exposed in the Quality Control menu
of your project, so that any authorized user can run them. You get all
the power of the FHIR Compute Cloud behind Simplifier to run these
checks.
