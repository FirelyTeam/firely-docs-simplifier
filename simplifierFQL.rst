FQL Playground
--------------

On Simplifier we have the `FQL playground<https://simplifier.net/fql>` available where you can try running your own queries in a scope of your choice.

As a scope you can select any publicly available package or project. You can run one of our example queries to get a quick understanding of all the possibilities with FQL.

You can also share the query you made with other Simplifier users or embed your query output in another website.
