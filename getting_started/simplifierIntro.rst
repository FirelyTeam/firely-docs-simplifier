Simplifier is a FHIR collaboration and publishing platform, where you can create, upload, download, find an view FHIR resources. Simplifier is the best place to collaborate on FHIR projects with your team. 

FHIR Registry
-------------

Simplifier is the backbone for the FHIR registry. The `FHIR registry <https://registry.fhir.org>`_ enables you to search for published FHIR resources created for STU3 in International, National, Institute or Regional projects on Simplifier.net. Test projects are excluded. The aim of this registry is to encourage re-use of profiles and extensions by providing a centralised search location for all of them. The registry supports free-text search as well as the following parameters:

* resourceType: search by resource type, (e.g. resourceType:Patient)
* jurisdiction: search by jurisdiction code in a conformance resource (e.g. jurisdiction:US)

Below you can download a quick guide to the FHIR registry, which was made for the HL7 Working Group Meeting in New Orleans (Jan, 2018).

Simplifier accounts
-------------------

Simplifier offers everyone a free plan which allows you to find and download resources from the Simplifier FHIR registry. Each user can add one public project for free, making the user the owner of the project. For professional users and organizations we offer several paid plans which come with `additional functionality and benefits <https://simplifier.net/pricing/>`_ . Paid accounts are able to create more and private projects depending on the account level.
