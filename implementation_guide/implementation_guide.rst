Implementation guide
====================

The Implementation Guide Editor on Simplifier enables you to make implementation guides (IGs) using the resources available in Simplifier. You can include your own project's Resources, package resources or those from others in your IG. 
With the help of this Markdown based editor you can easily construct an organized and practical IG that is both easy to read and navigate. This IG editor is available in all Simplifier account plans. Visit https://simplifier.net/pricing for more details. 

In the video below you will see a short tutorial of how to build your implementation guide in the Simplifier IG editor.
