YAML Gen Playground
===================

Yaml Gen is an experimental language from the Simplifier Team. Yaml is one of the shortest ways to define configuration and other structured data. Yaml Gen will help you generate resourecs, without having to maintain xml or json files. Through accellerators, you can be even more brief in your writing.
